    "I live in Bangkok, Thailand. The current city is full of coffee shop because drinking coffee is still popular in Thailand. Opening a coffee shop is one small business that many people are interested in. But finding the location to open the coffee shop should not be too close to the existing shop. In a location that is suitable for the opening of the shop, for example, there is no coffee shop in that area Finding the right location to open a coffee shop is therefore an interesting problem in the analysis to find a suitable location."
